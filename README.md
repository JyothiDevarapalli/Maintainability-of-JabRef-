# Maintainability-of-JabRef-
Evaluated the maintainability of JabRef Modules to improve its features and quality.

1)To understand the need for measuring, measurement frameworks. This includes measurement theory (scales, validation and meaningfulness), Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm, collection and analysis of data, classification of software metrics.

2)By applying GQM measurements framework, we have collected all the internal attributes(Cohesion, Coupling, Complexity, Understandability, Size) to measure the maintaibility of moduels.

3)The data was collected for all the 5 versions of JabRef modules from the MetricReloaded and CodeMR tools to measure the Internal Attributes. These attributes are measured using metrics (Coupling between objects, Response for a class, Lines of Code, Number of Methods, Number of children, Maximum complexity, Weighted Method per Class, Lack of Cohesion of Methods, Lack of tight class Cohesion).

4)The data collected was analysed visually and statistically to know which JabRef module was highly maintainable.
